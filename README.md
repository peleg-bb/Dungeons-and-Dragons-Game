# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Game
A command line interface game which features a player which can fight enemies through various levels.

The game was developed as an assignment in the Principles of OOP course in my 1st year as a Software Engineering Student. 

To play the game compile the code, create a jar (for Java 17) and run the following command in the cmd: java -jar hw3.jar <Path to directory of files>. The directory of files should be the path of 'levels_dir'
